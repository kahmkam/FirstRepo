Dear Funmi,

I had to stay up to put this together, hope after reading this, you will know how much you mean to me. 

I have known you for a very long time, back then in Selewu, I knew I was in love with you but couldn’t face you to tell you because I didn’t know how to, I didn’t know how to express this  feeling because it overwhelmed me all that time. I tried to kill it, but I only buried it, meeting you recently only confirmed that the feeling never died but grew stronger. 

Funmi, I know this might be strange to comprehend, but I want you to know that I’m so much in love with you and would want an opportunity to make you see how much actions I’m going to put into these words. 

I’m not perfect, no one is, however, if you let me love you, I will make sure my imperfections don’t stand in the way. 

Meeting you again revived what was dead in me. I thought I am not capable of loving again but here I’m yearning for your love. 

You are a beautiful, calm and intelligent woman. I hope you let me hold those soft palms of yours while I stare into those beautiful eyes as I tell you how much I respect, appreciate and love you. 

Thank you Funmi,

Kamkam
